# Dev Event: Software Engineering & Open Source

## Part 1: Frontend & Backend

### Project: Building a Task Management Web App

**Frontend Development**
- HTML structure for task lists, forms, and user interface
- CSS styling for responsive design and user experience
- JavaScript for client-side interactivity and DOM manipulation
- React for component-based architecture
- Next.js for SSR, routing, and optimization

**Backend Development**
- Node.js runtime environment
- Express for API endpoints and middleware
- Database integration (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)
- Authentication and authorization
- RESTful API design principles

**Advanced Concepts**
- Microservices: Breaking backend into independent services (auth service, task service, notification service)
- Microfrontend: Splitting UI into independently deployable modules
- System Design: Load balancing, caching strategies, database scaling, API gateways

**Learning Path**
1. Master HTML/CSS/JS fundamentals
2. Build Node.js/Express APIs
3. Create React components
4. Implement Next.js features
5. Design system architecture

## Part 3: Open Source Contribution

### Understanding OS Organizations

**Example Repository Analysis**
- Fork and clone workflow
- Issue tracking and project boards
- Pull request process
- Code review guidelines
- Documentation standards

**Getting Started**
1. Find beginner-friendly issues (good-first-issue tags)
2. Read CONTRIBUTING.md
3. Set up development environment
4. Make small, focused contributions
5. Engage with maintainers

**Example Organizations:** React, Node.js, Kubernetes, TensorFlow, VS Code

**Best Practices**
- Follow coding standards
- Write clear commit messages
- Test thoroughly before submitting
- Respond to feedback professionally
- Build consistent contribution history
